# About myself
I'm a former Researcher transitioning to Software Development, with 5+ years of experience in Data Analysis and a background in Data Science. Naturally inquisitive, problem-solver and good communicator. 

### What I used to do
Previous related experience includes developing an ETL pipeline from web scrapped data, predicting vote intention with decision trees from questionnaire data, assisting in predicting grade retention with decision trees based on a child development measurement. I have two peer-reviewed papers published, one book chapter and 10+ data driven reports addressed to authorities such as The World Bank.

I’m @IgVincon, former research assistant transitioning to software development. Previously, I worked as a core team member of INDI (a national scale applied research project) as a research assistant doing data analysis with Python. This brought me closer to the development side of things and got drawn in by the use of problem-solving skills and the possibility of creating something from scratch. Currently working as a Configuration Engineer for an American IT company that provides services for the insurance sector.

### What I'm learning
Frontend development: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`
    
Backend development: `Django`

### What I do in my free time
I mainly like to exercise and play board games in my free time. Currently I'm following [Gymnastic Bodies] routines and playing tennis, also looking to return to fencing some time soon (loved the foil). With regards to board games I can play from simple party games like [Magic Maze] or more complicated ones such as [Gloomhaven] (right now I'm trying out [Jaws of the Lion]). I also enjoy reading, specially at night when in bed. Nowadays I find myself reading [Lovecraft's] work, I recently finished [The Call of Cthulu] and now I'm reading [At the Mountains of Madness].
