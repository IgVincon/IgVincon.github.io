# About myself
I'm a former Researcher, with 5+ years of experience in Data Analysis and a background in Data Science, transitioning to Software Development. Naturally inquisitive, problem-solver and good communicator. 

### What I used to do
Previous related experience includes developing an ETL pipeline from web scrapped data, predicting vote intention with decision trees from questionnaire data, assisting in predicting grade retention with decision trees based on a child development measurement. I have two peer-reviewed papers published, one book chapter and 10+ data driven reports addressed to authorities such as The World Bank.

I’m @IgVincon, former research assistant transitioning to software development. Previously, I worked as a core team member of INDI (a national scale applied research project) as a research assistant doing data analysis with Python. This brought me closer to the development side of things and got drawn in by the use of problem-solving skills and the possibility of creating something from scratch. Currently working as a Configuration Engineer for an American IT company that provides services for the insurance sector.
