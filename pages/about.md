# About myself
I'm a former Researcher transitioning to Software Development, with work experience in Data Analysis and a background in Data Science. Naturally inquisitive, problem-solver and good communicator. 

### What I used to do
I worked as a Researcher for 5+ years as a core team member of [INDI], a national scale applied research project, doing data analysis with Python. There I got the chance to work on some interesting stuff as predicting grade retention with decision trees based on INDI's standardized results and an ETL pipeline from web scrapped data to assess [department research production]. During that time I co-authored two peer-reviewed papers[^1]<sup>,</sup> [^2], [a book chapter] and 10+ data driven reports addressed to authorities such as The World Bank.

The use of problem-solving skills, as well as Python, brought me closer to Data Science and in turn to Software Development. The similar skillset (albeit in a different way), plus the rush of creating something from scratch and making it work made me switch careers in a heartbeat. As a long-term goal, I would like to combine both my knowledge and expertise in research and data with software development to become an ML Engineer.

### Where I’m at now 
Currently I work as a Configuration Engineer for [Combined Ratio Solutions], an American IT company that works as a Software Factory providing services for the insurance sector. In my day-to-day tasks I mainly set up and test different companies' website. It usually involves technical skills (using X, Y, Z) as well as people skills when talking with clients.

### What I'm learning
Frontend development: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`
    
Backend development: `Django`

### What I do in my free time
I like to exercise, play board games and read. Currently I'm following [Gymnastic Bodies] routines, playing tennis and thinking of returning to fencing. I recently got [Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion] so I'm trying it out, but I also adore divergent games like [Magic Maze]. Nowadays I find myself reading Lovecraft's work, I recently finished [The Call of Cthulhu] and now I'm reading [At the Mountains of Madness].
